# Power-bi--PROJECT-COVID-19-DATA-ANALYSIS
COVID-19 Worldwide Analysis Power BI Project
Project Overview:
The COVID-19 worldwide analysis project was undertaken to visualize and analyze the impact of the pandemic across the globe using Power BI. The project involved importing data from an Excel file, performing data cleaning, and creating an interactive dashboard that provides insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19.

Data Import and Preparation:
Data Source: The data was sourced from an Excel file containing global COVID-19 statistics. The dataset included variables such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and dates.
Power Query Editor: After importing the data into Power BI, basic data cleaning was performed using Power Query Editor. This included:
Handling Missing Values: Identifying and dealing with any missing or inconsistent data.
Data Transformation: Ensuring the data types were correctly assigned, and columns were appropriately renamed for clarity.
Date Formatting: Standardizing date formats to enable accurate time series analysis.

Dashboard Creation:
The dashboard was designed to be both informative and user-friendly, providing a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Charts and Visualizations:
Stacked Bar Charts: These were used to display the distribution of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries across different regions and countries, providing a clear comparison.
Cards: Key metrics such as total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries were highlighted using cards, offering a quick snapshot of the critical data points.
Line and Stacked Column Charts: These charts were employed to show the trends over time, illustrating the progression of the pandemic in terms of cases and recoveries on a global scale.

Interactive Elements:
Buttons Linking to WHO Website: To provide users with easy access to authoritative information, buttons were integrated into the dashboard, linking directly to the World Health Organization (WHO) website.
Images and Contextual Information:
Newspaper Reports: Images of newspaper clippings and reports related to COVID-19 were inserted into the dashboard. This added a historical and narrative dimension to the data, helping users to contextualize the numbers within real-world events.

Tools and Features Explored:
Visual Customizations: Extensive use of Power BI's customization options allowed for a polished and professional-looking dashboard.
Data Slicing and Filtering: Slicers were used to enable users to filter the data by country, date range, and other relevant factors, allowing for a more personalized analysis experience.
Tooltips and Annotations: Tooltips were used to provide additional information when hovering over data points, and annotations were added to highlight significant events or trends.

Project Outcome:
The project resulted in a dynamic and interactive dashboard that allows users to explore COVID-19 data visually. By leveraging various features of Power BI, the dashboard effectively communicates the global impact of the pandemic and serves as a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making.
This project not only demonstrates proficiency in Power BI but also showcases the ability to manage and present complex data in an accessible and insightful manner.
